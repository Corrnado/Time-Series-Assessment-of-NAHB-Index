All data was downloaded from website "https://www.nahb.org/en/research/housing-economics/housing-indexes/housing-market-index.aspx". The naitonal NAHB index history data from Jan 2000 to Feb 2018 was converted to csv file in Excel.

```{r}
# import history data from the file and convert the data into time series object
nhist <- read.csv("national_history.csv", header = TRUE)
nhistts <- ts(nhist.adj[,2], frequency = 12, start = c(2000,1), end = c(2018,2))

# get a sense of what the data looks like
plot(nhistts)
hist(nhistts)
summary(nhistts)
nhisttscomp <- decompose(nhistts)
plot(nhisttscomp)
```

NAHB varies from 9 to 74 in the past and most of the time the index falled into 50-70. After decomposign the data, it is shown that there should be a seasonal pattern in the data and there is a rapid drop when 2008 finanacial crisis occured.
